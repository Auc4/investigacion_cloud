The security challenges associated with cloud computing have been widely studied in the literature. This systematic literature review (SLR) is aimed to review the existing research studies on cloud computing security, threats, and challenges. This SLR examined the research studies published between 2010 and 2020 within the popular digital libraries. We selected 80 papers after a meticulous screening of published works to answer the proposed research questions. The outcomes of this SLR reported seven major security threats to cloud computing services. The results showed that data tampering and leakage were among the highly discussed topics in the chosen literature. Other identified security risks were associated with the data intrusion and data storage in the cloud computing environment. This SLR’s results also indicated that consumers’ data outsourcing remains a challenge for both CSPs and cloud users. Our survey paper identified the blockchain as a partnering technology to alleviate security concerns. The SLR findings reveal some suggestions to be carried out in future works to bring data confidentiality, data integrity, and availability.},

  abstract = {The rise of cloud computing has brought significant advancements in scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, with multi-tenancy emerging as a core feature that allows multiple tenants to share the same physical infrastructure. However, this shared environment introduces serious security vulnerabilities, including data breaches, side-channel attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and insecure APIs, all of which threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of tenant data. The problem statement addressed in this study revolves around the challenge of securing multi-tenant environments, where resource sharing can expose tenants to risks stemming from improper isolation, malicious actors, and insufficient security measures. This study contributes to the field by providing a comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities and assessing the effectiveness of various countermeasures, such as enhanced isolation techniques, encryption, and access control mechanisms. A multi-faceted methodology, including literature review, case study analysis, risk assessment, and experimental simulations, was employed to evaluate these risks and their mitigation. The results reveal that, while security solutions like encryption and isolation can reduce the attack success rate to 5\%, they do introduce a performance overhead of 12\%. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of adhering to regulatory agreement frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA, realizing a compliance score of 9.2. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that effective implementation of security measures can expressively mitigate risks in multi-tenant cloud settings. However, it also highlights the trade-offs between show and security, urging cloud providers and leaseholders to adopt a shared charge model for ongoing monitoring and protection. Future technologies, such as AI-driven security results and zero-trust styles, are also submitted as likely advances to further support the security of cloud calculating systems.},

  abstract = {Mobile, application, and cloud platforms play a critical role in today’s digital services, yet their rapid convergence exposes users and organizations to intertwined attack surfaces. This review systematically examines the landscape of threats, vulnerabilities, and defense mechanisms across these different domains to guide evidence-based security decisions. The study followed the PRISMA 2020 framework and included research published between 2011 and 2025 identified through systematic searches of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. After screening, 106 studies were included. The systematic search comprised of journal articles (50.48\%) and systematic literature reviews (44.66\%), with leading contributions from China (22.33\%), India (12.62\%), Morocco (7.77\%), Pakistan (6.80\%), and Australia (5.83\%). Domain coverage comprised Cloud Security (38.83\%), Multi/IoT (31.07\%), Mobile Security (20.39\%), and Application Security (9.71\%). The most reported vulnerabilities were DDoS (9.71\%), malware (8.74\%), insecure APIs (8.74\%), data breaches (7.77\%), misconfigurations (6.80\%), and injection flaws (6.80\%); prevalent threats included DDoS (15.53\%), phishing (7.77\%), insider misuse (6.80\%), and MitM (5.83\%). Defenses were led by IDS/IPS (24.27\%), machine learning (18.45\%), cryptography (17.48\%), deep learning (16.50\%), and blockchain (10.68\%), typically embedded in layered architectures (24.27\%). Privacy was explicitly addressed in 69.90\% of studies. Persistent limitations were scalability (19.42\%), lack of real-world validation (15.53\%), interoperability/standardization gaps (10.68\%), and dataset/benchmark constraints (7.77\%). The evidence confirms substantial protective value but reveals underutilization of unified cross-domain models. We propose a consolidated perspective that links vulnerabilities, threats, ~defenses, privacy, outlining priority directions for scalable, interoperable, and empirically validated security across mobile, application, and cloud ecosystems.},

Although the innovative capabilities of cloud services attract users, they can also create new threats to their information security. This is why research into cloud computing is important to understand its potential and effectiveness. This study will look at the security aspect of cloud services and compare several different platforms because the lack of sufficient protection can lead to the theft of personal data and other confidential information. The study will also look at the most common threats faced by cloud services, such as DDoS attacks, data leaks, data abuse, etc. In particular, the security measures provided by leading cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Azure will be analyzed to determine their effectiveness and reliability. Our analysis will be useful for companies considering moving to the cloud and everyday users trying to keep their data safe online. The results of the study will provide a clear understanding of the benefits and limitations of using various cloud platforms from a security perspective.},

  abstract = {Cloud storage has become an essential computational model today, providing flexible, defective resistant resources and dramatically reducing costs. However, there are major obstacles to protection issues in the wider adoption market. The multiformity of the cloud and the multi-location storing of data exacerbate these problems. The major issues to be discussed in protection are secrecy, authenticity, honesty, availability and auditability. Enabling more customers to switch to the cloud environment would allow for safe data and transfers from the service provider. Intrusion Detection Mechanisms, Cryptographic Methodology and Electronic Forensic Software are some of the assurance that a trustful service provider will have for the recuperation and collection of digital proof of intrusion activities. This paper provides a survey into some of the prevalent challenges, risks and ways to resolve these challenges in cloud platforms. We also discussed major cloud storage service for data storage and protection model.},

  abstract = {The digital transformation is a dynamic process that unfolds within the data and information cycle, aimed at maximizing the efficiency businesses derive from data and information. For the structuring and sustenance of this process require information processing resources, typically sourced from cloud computing infrastructures. In this context, the aim of this study is to scrutinize the cyber security measures provided by both public and private IaaS infrastructures, aiding businesses in their selection process for digital transformation. To address the objectives of this research, a mixed-methods approach was adopted, integrating both qualitative and quantitative research techniques. The study is structured around two primary research questions. The first research question (RQ1) seeks to delineate the cyber security measures in Amazon AWS EC2, Google Cloud CE, and Proxmox VE IaaS (Internet as a Service) infrastructures. The second research question (RQ2) aims to identify the similarities and differences in cyber security measures across these infrastructures. Additionally, to verify the findings derived from (RQ1) ensure the credibility of the study, and to experimentally examine cyber security measures within these infrastructures, the study adopts an experimental research method from quantitative analysis techniques and the hypothesis (H0) " The findings obtained as a result of RQ1 are confirmed in AWS EC2 and Google Cloud CE IaaS infrastructures" is tested. As a result of the experimental research, hypothesis H0 was accepted. A review of existing literature, there has been encountered no research that concurrently examines, compares, and experimentally verifies the cybersecurity measures across both public and private IaaS infrastructures. Therefore, this study can be considered to make an original contribution to the existing body of knowledge by addressing an important gap in the literature on the comparative and experimental evaluation of cyber security practices in public and private IaaS infrastructures.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of the shared responsibility model on cloud security posture and vulnerability management. The shared responsibility model divides security roles between cloud service providers and customers, with providers securing the cloud infrastructure and customers responsible for securing their data, applications, and access controls. Misunderstanding or neglecting these responsibilities can lead to significant vulnerabilities, exposing organizations to security risks such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and regulatory non-compliance. The study examines the different responsibilities in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models, highlighting how organizations can effectively manage their security posture within each model. Key practices, such as encryption, identity and access management (IAM), vulnerability scanning, and patch management, are analyzed to provide insights into best practices for maintaining a secure cloud environment. Additionally, the paper explores how automation tools and cloud provider services can assist in vulnerability management, enabling organizations to maintain a proactive security stance. By understanding the nuances of the shared responsibility model and employing best practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of cloud vulnerabilities. The findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring, automated security controls, and clear communication between cloud providers and customers to ensure a secure and resilient cloud infrastructure.

  abstract = {Cloud misconfigurations in financial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications pose significant cybersecurity risks, leading to data breaches, financial losses, and reputational harm. This study utilizes data from the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Top Threats Dataset, Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), and the MITRE ATT\&CK Framework to examine the causes and types of misconfigurations, analyze their financial impact, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. A Chi-Square Test for Independence, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, and Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis were employed to quantify these risks. Findings indicate that IAM errors (183 occurrences) and exposed APIs (156 occurrences) are the most frequent misconfigurations, with high-severity misconfigurations resulting in an average financial loss of \$7.6M and regulatory fines of \$2.5M. Implementation of Zero Trust Architecture, Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), and strict IAM controls reduced breach probability from 70\% to 40\%. This study examines cloud misconfigurations in financial SaaS applications using datasets from 2018 to 2024, providing a risk quantification of security threats and a financial impact assessment of breaches. Findings reveal that IAM errors and exposed APIs are the most frequent misconfigurations, causing severe financial losses. The effectiveness of Zero Trust and CSPM in reducing breach probability is analyzed. Future research should explore AI-driven security solutions for real-time misconfiguration detection and automated risk prevention in cloud environments. Recommendations include automating security controls, enforcing Zero Trust policies, integrating security training, and strengthening regulatory compliance.},
